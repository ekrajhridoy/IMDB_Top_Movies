# IMDB_Top_Movies
This dataset contains information about top-rated movies, including their titles, IMDb ratings, vote counts, release years, and watch times. The data was scraped using Selenium from IMDb and later cleaned using Pandas.

During preprocessing:

Leading numbers were removed from movie names

Release year and watch time were split into separate columns

Unnecessary columns were dropped

Parentheses were removed from vote counts

This cleaned dataset is now ready for data analysis and visualization â€” perfect for exploring trends in movie ratings, durations, and viewer engagement!
